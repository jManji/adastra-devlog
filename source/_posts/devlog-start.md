Hey everyone! Welcome to my blog, where I will be talking about the development of my new game, **Ad Astra**. I am quite new to game development and the technologies around it, so progress will be slow. I aim to post regularly about anything interesting or challenging I find along the way.

## What is Ad Astra?
Ad Astra will be an asteroids-like space shooter. It will be a fast-paced, “shoot first think later” kind of game. Some ideas are there, but definitely some will come later. I imagine I will be iterating over some features, until I have something that works.

Obviously I am not expecting this to be a state of the art game; it will at best be a prototype for a later, better version, or just a good learning exercise. 

## Tech
Ad Astra will be a browser game, built using JavaScript and the Phaser game framework. As Phaser 3 is still being in active development, it will take a few months (being optimistic), before it’s out and stable enough to use. Thus, the maintainted {% link Phaser 2 Community Edition https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce Phaser CE %} is a safe option for now.
