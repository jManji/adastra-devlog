Hey everyone! Welcome to my devlog, where I will be talking about the development of my new game, **Ad Astra**. I am quite new to this and the technologies around it, so progress will be slow. I aim to post regularly about anything interesting or challenging I find along the way.

## What is Ad Astra?
Ad Astra will be an asteroids-like space shooter, with a couple of twists. It will be a fast-paced, “shoot first think later” kind of game. Some ideas are there, but definitely some will come later. To begin with, I will be focusing on getting the feeling right, working on things like movement, camera etc, before moving on to more specific gameplay mechanics.

Obviously I am not expecting this to be a state of the art game; it will at best be a prototype for a later better version of it, if that ever happens. For now, I am just learning and having fun :-).

## Tech
Ad Astra will be a browser game, built using JavaScript and the Phaser game framework. With Phaser 3, being in development, it will take a few months (being optimistic), before it’s out and stable enough to use. Thus, the maintainted Phaser 2 Community Edition is a safe option for now.
